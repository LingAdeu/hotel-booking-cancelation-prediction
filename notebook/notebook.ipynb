    "# <b>1 Introduction</b>\n",
    "<b>Content</b>: Efficient management in hotel booking plays significant roles in maximizing revenue and optimizing operational resources. But room booking cancellations pose a significant challenge to a hotel, leading to revenue loss and not optimal resource allocation. Understanding and predicing hoel booking cancellations can provide a competitive point by peveraging proractive measure to mitigate the negative consequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Problem Statement</b>: In the hospitality industry, managing hotel bookings efficiently is crucial for maximizing revenue and optimizing resources. However, one of the significant challenges faced by hotel managers is room booking cancellations, which can lead to revenue loss and operational inefficiencies. To address this challenge, my aim is to develop a machine learning classification model to predict hotel booking cancellations.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Objective</b>: This project aims to develop a machine learning classification model to predict hotel booking cancellations. By leveraging historical booking data and various features associated with each booking record, I intend to build a predictive model that can classify bookings into \"Canceled\" (`1`) or \"Not Canceled\" (`0`) categories. This model will enable hotel managers to allocate resources more effectively, optimize inventory management to reduce potential revenue loss due to cancellations.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Analytical Approach</b>\n",
    "- <b>Step-1</b>: Perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the characteristics of data before building a classification model.\n",
    "- <b>Step-2</b>: Build a classification model to predict the probability of customers canceling their hotel booking.\n",
    "- <b>Step-3</b>: Identify key factors underlie the cancelation of hotel bookings.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Metrics</b>: The focus of this analysis lies in mitigating the impact of false negatives (Type II errors), as they pose a higher financial risk to the hotel. However, a consideration is also given to minimizing false positives (Type I errors) to maintain operational efficiency.\n",
    "- <b>Type I Error (False Positive)</b>: When the model incorrectly identifies a booking as canceled (Type I error), it may lead to overbooking or unnecessary actions by the hotel such as providing compensation to guests by offering similar or better room types.\n",
    "\t- Assuming an average loss is between USD10 and USD67.5 (see the simulation below) per false positive to upgrade hotel rooms, the total monthly loss will be in the range of USD1000 to USD6750 for 100 errors according to [Budget Your Trip](https://www.budgetyourtrip.com/hotels/portugal-PT). \n",
    "- <b>Type II Error (False Negative)</b>: When the model fails to predict a cancellation (Type II error), the hotel may lose revenue equivalent to the average price of a hotel room. In Portugal, this amounts to USD99 per night according to [Budget Your Trip](https://www.budgetyourtrip.com/hotels/portugal-PT).\n",
    "\t- Assuming the model makes 100 false negatives in a month, the total financial loss for the hotel could reach USD9,900.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the higher financial implications of Type II errors, the primary focus of the classification model is to minimize their occurrence. Therefore, the main evaluation metric for model performance will be $F_2$ score which provides a balanced consideratrion of precision and recall, with greater emphasis on recall to reduce Type II errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Dataset</b>: A dataset containing historical hotel booking records, including information such as booking dates, customer demographics, booking channels, room types, and reservation details will be utilized to build a predictive model. The dataset will be preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables before training the classification model.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Features</b>\n",
    "- `country` (string): Country of origin.\n",
    "- `market_segment` (string): Market segment designation. \n",
    "- `previous_cancellations`: Number of previous bookings that were cancelled by the customer prior to the current booking.\n",
    "- `booking_changes` (integer): Number of changes/amendments made to the booking from the moment the booking was entered on the PMS until the moment of check-in or cancellation.\n",
    "- `deposit_type` (string): Indication on if the customer made a deposit to guarantee the booking. \n",
    "- `days_in_waiting_list` (integer): Number of days the booking was in the waiting list before it was confirmed to the customer.\n",
    "- `customer_type`: Type of booking.\n",
    "- `reserved_room_type` (string): Code of room type reserved. Code is presented instead of designation for anonymity reasons.\n",
    "- `required_car_parking_space` (integer): Number of car parking spaces required by the customer.\n",
    "- `total_of_special_request` (integer): Number of special requests made by the customer (e.g. twin bed or high floor).\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Target</b>\n",
    "- `is_canceled` (integer): Value indicating if the booking was canceled (1) or not canceled (0).\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Expected Outcome</b>\n",
    "By successfully developing and deploying the predictive model, we expect the following outcomes:\n",
    "- Improved efficiency in resource allocation and inventory management.\n",
    "- Reduction in revenue loss associated with booking cancellations."

    "- <b>General Observation</b>\n",
    "    - The dataset contains 83,573 booking records in and 11 columns, including `is_canceled` as the target variable.\n",
    "    - Based on the columns, the categorical variables (object) are `country`, `market_segment`, `deposit_type`, `customer_type`, and `reserved_room` while the numerical columns (int64) are `previous_cancellations`, `booking_changes`, `days_in_waiting_list`, `required_car_parking_spaces`, `total_of_special_request`.\n",
    "    - Other than these, the dataset also has `is_cancelled` which will be used as the target variable. It consists of binary numbers, i.e., `0` for not canceled and `1` for canceled.\n",
    "    - The missing value rate is 0.42% detected in column `country`. This issue will be further checked in the following section.\n",
    "- <b>Notes on data types and scales of measurement</b>\n",
    "    - All categorical variables will be converted into numerical (e.g., onehot, binary, or ordinal encodings) so they can be processed in the modeling process. And as none of these variables contains intrinsic orders (or ranks) in their categories, none of them will be converted using ordinal encoding. \n",
    "    - Numerical variables will also be pre-processed in order to make them have the same unit. For example, the range of values in `days_in_waiting_list` is wide, starting from 0 to 391, whereas values in `total_of_special_requests` range between 0 to 5. If the values are not rescaled, `days_in_waiting_list` will affect the model due to the larger values.\n",
    "- <b>Scales of measurement</b>\n",
    "    - Nominal: values with no particular orders. In the dataset, nominal columns are `country`, `market_segment`, `deposit_type`, `customer_type`, `reserved_room_type`, and `is_canceled`\n",
    "    - Ordinal: values with ranked order. In the dataset there are no ordinal columns.\n",
    "    - Interval: The interval between two numerical values should be equal, e.g., time. But there are no interval data in the dataset.\n",
    "    - Ratio: Scale with equal interval between values and possibility of true zero. In the dataset, ratio includes `previous_cancellations`, `booking_changes`, `days_in_waiting_list`, `required_car_parking_spaces`, and `total_of_special_requests`."

To accomplish this task, cancellation statuses in column `is_canceled` will be paired up with other categories. But it is important to note that this section is only meant to understand the data patterns prior to modeling only, not to provide insights to the stakeholder (hotel managers). For example, the EDA focuses on whether there are any medium to high correlations between features, whether the distributions of data across different variables are normal, and how different categorical values are distributed in the variables."

    "- The cancelation rate is quite high. The rate constitutes 37% from the total bookings in the hotel. While it is slightly lower than the global hotel booking [cancelation rate](https://hospitalitytech.com/global-cancellation-rate-hotel-reservations-reaches-40-average) (40%), this number has been quite alarming given the financial loss faced by the hotel.\n",
    "- Another important point is the balanced or imbalanced proportion. According to the bar plot, the proportion between category 'Canceled' and 'Not Canceled' is slightly imbalanced (0.37 vs 0.63) based on Brownlee (2020, p.6). Hovever, because <b>this proportion may change</b> because the data used for EDA has not been cleaned up yet. The data cleaning process is carried out in the next section."

    "- Customers using Online Travel Agencies (Online TA) canceled the hotel bookings far more often than other market segments. The number of cancellations constitute 14.4k with the online TA. This means that customers booking through online TA contribute significantly to the hotel's cancellation count.\n",
    "- In addition to Online TA, Groups and Offline TA/TO segments also have substantial cancellations with 8.4K and 5.7K cancellations, respectively. This suggests that group bookings and those made through traditional travel agencies or tour operators are prone to cancellations.\n",
    "- <b>Next step</b>: Value `Undefined` in column `market_segment` will be removed because it will somehow be detected as an error by PyCaret."

    "- So far, we see that all numerical variables indicate non-normal data distribution, emphasizing the use of Spearman $\\rho$ for the correlation test. \n",
    "- Both numerical (Spearman $\\rho$) and categorical variables ($\\phi k$) show either weak or moderate correlations. And for moderate correlations, `country`, `market_segment`, and `deposit_type` will be droped.\n",
    "- There is an imbalanced data in the target variable (`is_canceled`) but since the duplicate check will be checked in the Data Preparation section, it remains an open question so far whether the proportion of categories in the target variable is *really* imbalanced.\n",
    "- The majority of cancellations are associated with customers with the following characteristics: Most of them originate from Portugal; use online travel agencies; made bookings with no deposits; stay for a short period of time (transient); and book room type A.\n",
    "- Moreover, in the Initial Data Inspection section, I already pointed out some possibility of using different data encoding techniques, particularly onehot or binary encoding. And as previously mentioned, to determine which encoding technique to choose will depend on the number of unique values in each categorical variables. Judging the count of unique values only, `market_segment`, `deposit_type`, and `customer_type` can be encoded using onehot encoder whereas binary encoding can be applied to `reserved_room_type` due to its high number of unique value.\n",
    "- Feature engineering technique appropriate for umerical variables (`previous_cancellations`, `booking_changes`, `days_in_waiting_list`, `required_car_parking_spaces`, and `total_of_special_requests`) remains an open question and will further be explored in section 3 to check if there are outliers."

    "- The missing value rate is 0.42% of the total observations. Because of this small rate, two options are available: (1) Because the data type is categorical, data imputation using the mode (most frequent value) of values in column `country` can be done. The small rate will give a minimal effect on the distribution. (2) Alternatively, missing value removal can also be done due to the same consideration, i.e., small proportion of missing values.\n",

    "    - This feature shows a moderate correlation between different variables based on the $\\phi k$ values, indicating potential collinearity when paired up with another categorical variable, as mentioned above.\n",
    "    - This feature also contains a great number of unique value (high cardinality), potentially indicating rare labels. The high cardinality is usually related to rare labels. This will be checked deeper below."

    "- The dataset exhibits a high duplicate rate of 87.79%. This requires a removal as duplicates can significantly impact the performance of the classification model. For instance, the training set (`df_seen`) contains a number of rows with identical values to those in the test set (`df_unseen`). As a result, when evaluating the trained model with the test set, the model <u>memorizes</u> these values instead of <u>learning</u> the geneeral patterns, predisposing it to overfitting.\n",
    "- In general overfitting cocurrs when a model encounters the same data points multiple times due to duplicates, the model will learn to fit the training data too closely, not learning the generalizable patterns. This can lead to poorer performance when the model is applied to new, unseen data even though high performance in the seen (training) data."

This underscores the importance of rechecking duplicates based on the remaining features listed below. Once again, this check and treatment must be done to minimize potential overfitting due to the presence of similar rows after data spliting."

    "- Except column `total_of_special_request`, all numerical columns specified in the code contain outliers, starting from `required_car_parking_spaces` with 0.24% of outliers to `days_in_waiting_list` with a considerable number of outliers (22.98%).\n",
    "- While winsorization and log transformation are some possible treatments to outliers, winsorizing data with a considerable number of outliers in `days_in_waiting_list` and `previous_cancellations` can significantly change the data distribution, making the transformed version have have considerable difference to the original one. Additionally, log tansformed data will make the interpretation less intuitive because the values are in a logarithmic scale. Log transformation will also change the underlying structure of original data if it has a non-linear relationship\n",
    "- As a consequence, at least two options to treat outliers are available, namely robust scaling and equal frequency discretization (binning):\n",
    "    - <b>Equal frequency binning</b>: This binning technique group numerical values into a number of bins with the same number of observations. While this technique can reduce the effect of outliers due to grouping them into the equal frequency, binning can cause information loss which is crucial for modeling.\n",
    "    - <b>Robust scaling</b>: This scaling technique convert numerical features into a similar range and is less sensitive to outliers since it uses median and interquartile range (IQR) in its formula. This technique will be particularly useful when the classification task is done by using distance-related models such as k-Nearest Neighbors or Support Vector Machines\n",
    "- Since both feature engineering techniques can be used to minimize the effects of extreme values in numerical features, both techniques will be experimented in the next section to see which techniques can produce a better performing classification model."

This check will provides an understanding of how categorical variable is distributed in the dataset, particularly in terms of variability. This step is essential because a large number of unique values in a column can pose challenges for the classification models.

In addition to its high cardinality, it was also mentioned in section 2 that this column has a moderate correlation with the target variable ($\\phi k$ = 0.44), so there is more evidence to exclude this feature from the modeling phase.\n",
    "- Furthermore, including this feature to the classification model might introduce bias to the model. For example, as previously seen on the EDA, the majority of guests originate from Portugal and only a few of them are from Macedonia (MKD) or Mauritus (MUS, see below). Underrepresented groups may not be adequately captured by the model, leading to poorer performance or unfair treatment of these groups. As a result, dropping this feature can help mitigating this bias."

    "- The threshold is the cut off value to consider whether a column contains rare labels or not. With such threshold, any labels occur less than 5% of the total number of observations or rows will be considered 'rare'.\n",

    "# <b>4 Model Experiment</b>\n",
    "In this experiment, my purpose is to train multiple baseline classification models using PyCaret `setup()` function with custom preprocessor (`pipeline`). The models will be primarily evaluated using $F_2$ score since the focus of the classification model is to reduce the Type II Error, that is incorrect identification of a booking as canceled. Before moving on to the model training, here is an overview of the metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>F2</b> (also called $F_{\\beta}$ or weighted $F$-score): In general, $F_2$ is similar to $F_1$ which takes both precision and recall into account but $F_2$ underscores the recall more than precision by penalizing false negative (FN) more than false positive. My reason is that false negative (Type II error) is financially more costly than false positive as stated in the Introduction section. And to calculate the $F_2$ score, we can use the following formula: $$\\text{F2 score}=(1+\\beta^2) \\times \\frac{(\\text{Precision} \\times \\text{Recall})}{(\\beta^2 \\times \\text{Precision}) + \\text{Recall}}$$\n",
    "- Just to recap what precision is in the $F_2$ formula, <b>precision</b> is a measure of accuracy of the classification model. Here is the detail: $$\\text{Precision}=\\frac{TP}{TP + FP}$$\n",
    "- <b>Recall</b> measures the proportion of actual positive instances that were correctly classified by the model. Higher recall indicates fewer false negatives, which is crucial because my purpose is to capture all instances of hotel cancellations. Formula: $$\\text{Recall}=\\frac{TP}{TP + FN}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "By default PyCaret does not show $F_2$ score and will only provide several metrics such as accuracy, area under the ROC AUC curve, recall (sensitivity), precision, $F_1$ score, kappa ($\\kappa$), and Mathews Correlation Coefficient (MCC). To add $F_2$, I will use use `f_beta_score` from Scikit-learn."

To note, this is the original model which neither uses scaling or binning technique yet to minimize the output of the outliers in some numerical features. These feature engineering technique will be tested in the following experiment.\n",

    "- The first-two steps in the pipeline adopt the same encoding techniques as to those in Experiment 1.\n",
    "- <b>Robust scaling</b>: The robust scaling transform numerical variables into the similar range. This transformation was chosen because several numerical features contain outliers (`previous_cancellations`, `booking_changes`, `days_in_waiting_list`, `required_car_parking_spaces`). Each feature value is transformed by subtracting the median and then dividing by the IQR $$X_{\\text{scaled}}=\\frac{X-\\text{median}(X)}{IQR(X)}$$\n",

    "- The table summarizes the training results of all estimators (e.g., Naive Bayes, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, K Nearest Neighbour, etc.), and sorted particularly based on $F_2$ score. This metric prioritizes reducing False Negative (a booking cancellation when it doesn't happen).\n",
    "- Based on the $F_2$ score, the best performing models are Naive Bayes, constituting 0.6889. \n",
    "- Before moving on to the next experiment to see some effects of modifying the inputs on the outputs, a hyperparameter tuning will be firstly done. The hyperparameter to set is variance smoothing (vars_smoothing). By default, the value set by [Sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.naive_bayes.GaussianNB.html) is 1e-09. Other values as mentioned previously in Experiment 1 are also used for the smoothing."

The proportion is above the treshold for light imbalance (40% vs 60%). In this experiment, I attempt to conduct an experiment using polynomial features and see how this technique can improve the model's ability to classify the minority class.\n"

    "- The pipeline is slightly longer than the pipeline in experiment 1 due to the addition of polynomial features.\n",
    "- After encoding some categorical features, the pipeline continues to converting `reserved_room_type` into binary values. Afterwards, the last step generates polynomial features. The goal of this feature engineering technique is to make the classification models easier in distinguishing classes Cancelled (`1`) and Not Cancelled (`0`)."

    "- This algorithm calculatyes the probability of each class based on the probability of the class and the likelihood of the features.\n",
    "- As an illustration, let's take a look at the snippet of the dataset below. To note, this is a simplified version as it doesn't take all features associated to the cancellation status (0: Not Canceled, 1: Canceled) into account."

    "- Initially, around 100-200 samples, the training metrics starts high (0.85), indicating that the model fits the training data well when the dataset is small. However, as the training size increases, the training score decreases, stabilizing around 0.73 for larger training set. This suggests that the when the model is exposed to more data, it will capures more variability, resulting in a lower training score.\n",
    "- The testing metric starts low around 0.65, the testing score increases, reaching around 0.73-0.74 and then plateauing. This shows the model's generalization improves with more data until it gains sufficient information.\n",
    "- Both training and testing metrics converge around 0.73-0.74, suggesting the model is not overfitting as the performance across training and testing data is similar. "

    "- The microaverage AUC (overall performance) indicates overall performance across all cases, giving equal weight to each cass. 0.67 suggests the overall model's performance is moderate.\n",

    "- The Naive Bayes model uses various features from the hotel booking data to predict cancellations. These features include a customer's cancellation history (`previous_cancellations`), booking modifications (booking_changes), waiting list status (`days_in_waiting_list`), parking needs (`required_car_parking_spaces`), and special requests (`total_of_special_requests`). \n",
    "- While these features provide insights into booking behavior, it's important to remember that Naive Bayes assumes features are independent of each other. \n",
    "- In reality, features like `booking_changes` and `days_in_waiting_list` might be correlated (customers who wait longer might make more changes). This limitation of the model could potentially affect its accuracy. \n",
    "- Additionally, the model handles categorical features like `customer_type` (transient party, transient, contract, group) by converting them into numerical representations internally.\n",
    "- Now let's break down each variable.\n",
    "    - `previous_cancellations`: the value ranges between 0 and 26 times. \n",
    "    - `booking_changes`: the value ranges between 0 and 21 times.\n",
    "    - `days_in_waiting_list`: The waiting list is between 0 to 391 days.\n",
    "    - `required_car_parking_spaces`: The hotel provides different number of parking spaces starting from 0 to 8 to accommodate guests parking their cars at the hotel.\n",
    "    - `total_of_special_requests`: The number of special requests by the guests in total is between 0 and 5.\n",
    "    - `reserved_room_type`: 10 types of rooms available in the hotel represented by letter A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, P, and L.\n",
    "    - `customer_type`: There are 4 types of customers in the training data, namely transient party, transient, contract, and group.\n",
    "- This means that outside the described ranges the model's predictions will be inaccurate. "

    "## <b>6.1 Conclusions</b>\n",
    "This project aims to develop a machine learning classification model to predict hotel booking cancellations with a focus on minimizing False Negative (Type II Error). A series of machine learning experiments on the hotel's historical data have been carried out to find the best model in achieving such goal. In general, this project consists of 7 experiments, utilizing different focuses. \n",
    "- <b>Experiment 1</b> was designed to be the baseline of the model performance, checking how good the original model performed. The best model of this experiment was compared to the results of the next-two experiments.\n",
    "- <b>Experiment 2</b> used robust scaling to see if scaling numeric features with outliers could produce a better performing model.\n",
    "- In <b>Experiment 3</b>, quantile binning (equal frequency discretization) was utilized to investigate to what extent binning features with outliers could affected the model. Among the first three experiments, this experiment yielded the best performing model. As a result, the setup was used in the following experiments.\n",
    "- Continuing Experiment 3, <b>Experiment 4</b> added polynomial features to make the model easier in distinguishing targets. The rationale of this addition was the uneven distribution between the binary labels in the target variable.\n",
    "- <b>Experiment 5</b> aimed to investigate the extent to which nearmiss version 3 could handle the imbalance label issue and produced the best model.\n",
    "- <b>Experiment 6</b> is similar to Experiment 5 in which imbalanced label issue was sought to solve.\n",
    "- Based on Experiment 4 to Experiment 6, the setup in Experiment 4 could gave the best performing model. The top-three best model from Experiment 4 were used to build a blended model in <b>Experiment 7</b>.\n",

    "<b>For Hotel Managers</b>\n",
    "- Utilize the model's predictions to proactively manage bookings. For instance, if a booking is likely to be canceled, consider implementing strategies such as offering incentives or reaching out to guests to confirm their stays to minimize the impact of cancellations on revenue, occupancy rates, and operational efficiency.\n",
    "- Evaluate the impact of the model-driven decisions on operational improvements, e.g., by using A/B testing. The evaluation can cover metrics such as cancellation rate and revenue during a specific period to determine the effectiveness of the classification model in optimizing hotel operations.\n",
    "- Optimize operational resource allocation based on cancellation predictions to minimize waste and maximize efficiency. Allocate staff, inventory, and services in alignment with expected booking patterns and anticipated cancellations, ensuring optimal utilization of resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>For Future Directions</b>\n",
    "- Improve the data quality due to a great number of duplicates in the dataset prior to data cleaning.\n",
    "- While we already implemented a series of experiments with a number of setups, including different algorithms and feature engineering techniques, to handle various problems in the dataset such as imbalanced labels and outliers, try to perform experiments with another setup. This potentially yields a better performing model based on F2."

    "- As the training set increases, the classification error on the training set decreases but after certain point, the error remains stable, suggesting the model has learned most of the patterns and adding more data does not significantly improve the model's performance.\n",
    "- As the training set decreases, the test set error decreases, indicating ability to generalize to unseen data improves with more training data. It means that the model generalizes well to unseen data at the beginning but may start to overfit if too much training data is used.\n",
    "- The optimal training set is around the lowest test error. After this point, adding more data may not be beneficial."
